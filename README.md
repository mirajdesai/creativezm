to do

note: the site has a landing page which is the home page. and then then the other SECTIONS include the about section, the serivces section and then the contact section.

in the navigation bar I want the ABOUT SERVICES and CONTACT  words to light up orange and remain orange depending on which page you are on. 
at the moment it simply lights up orange as you hover on it.

change the contact us section background to #F4F4F4

for the about section
notice there are four quadrants and a black circle in the middle
in each quadrant the icon and text look displaced and not organized
I want you to use your design skills and make them look organized
maybe stack the icon and the text next to each other. sometimes using more the one line if the whole text doesn’t fit it
do what you have to and make it look nice and organized and professional.


the section below the about section (i.e the section with the picture of the hands typing on the keyboard)  its too extended. you need to reduce the length of that by one third.

also notice the extra spacing above and below the ‘Services’ title and also the spacing above and below the “what we do” text. fix that and make it look nice.

below that make the “branding and advertising” title parallel with the “social” title - its a little of no w.

Below 700px screen width (the six pieces of content should be stacked on top of each other)


The section” reach out to us and lets build something great together” decrease the size of that to  2/3rds of the length.



mobile view size

LANDING HOME PAGE
this is pretty important as this sis th page that users will se first.
it looks excellent in desktop laptop size but whe you start decreasing the window size the text size for the title "creativzm" and the sub title " WEB - DESIGN - SOCIAL - BRANDING - ADVERTISING " are not consitent. Somtimes it's too small and sometimes its too big for the screen size.
use your creative skills and your judgement  and make it adjust the size of text and styles so that it ooks nice on all sizes.  (you will have to adjudt it at mobile size and tablet size)


ABOUT US SECTION
in the mobile view about us section disappears, fix that.
in mobile view that section should have all four sections stacked on each other
i.e in full view its two columns two rows, in mobile view it should be 1 column and 4 rows. each row should be atleast 1CM (with the icon and the title) with a little part of the picture in the background

 then we have to consider the circle in the middle the black we are your one stop digital agency
I have an idea for that. instead of 4 rows make it 5 rows and one column  so logically to include the black circle (it will be a rectangle in mobile view) the row in the middle i.e the third row will be black and have the text we are your one stop digital agency. alter the font sizes and icon sizes so that it looks nice.
ultimateley in mobile view the about section will be five reactangle stacked on top of each other. each the same size.

SERVICES SECTION
stack all of those 6 colums on top of each other, adjust text size and icon size so that it looks good
